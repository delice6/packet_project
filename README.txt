# Packet Project

Packet Project - Explore layers of data in sample, LiveCapture or recently captured PCAP files from Wireshark using pyshark and tshark 
libraries. Begin by filtering and printing layers by different headers (i.e. protocol) and examining potential places of interest. Additional
work attempts to capture passwords off the wire (but requires GNS3) and identify suspicious behaviors.
